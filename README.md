OVERVIEW
--------
`pop-auth` provides integrated adapters to authenticate users with a file, a database,
over HTTP or with a LDAP server. It also includes support for authenticating using
encrypted passwords.

`pop-auth` is a component of the [Pop PHP Framework](http://www.popphp.org/).

INSTALL
-------

Install `pop-auth` using Composer.

    composer require popphp/pop-auth

BASIC USAGE
-----------

### Authenticate using a file

For this example, we use a file called '.htmyauth' containing a colon-delimited
list of usernames and passwords (normally, we wouldn't use clear text):
  
    admin:12admin34
    editor:12edit34
    reader:12read34

```php
use Pop\Auth\Auth;
use Pop\Auth\Adapter\File;

$auth = new Auth(new File('/path/to/.htmyauth'));
$auth->authenticate('admin', '12admin34');

if ($auth->isValid()) { } // Returns true 
```

### Authenticate using a table in a database and encryption

For this example, there is a table in a database called 'users' and a correlating table class
called 'MyApp\Users' that extends 'Pop\Db\Record' (for more on this, visit the Pop Db component.)

For simplicity, the table has a column called 'username' and a column called 'password.'
The value of the 'password' column is encrypted using bcrypt. These are all options that
can be set to whatever the user decides them to be. But, by default, the table adapter
will look for a 'username' column and a 'password' column unless otherwise specified.

```php
use Pop\Auth\Auth;
use Pop\Auth\Adapter\Table;

$auth = new Auth(new Table('MyApp\Users'), Auth::ENCRYPT_BCRYPT);

// Attempt #1
$auth->authenticate('admin', 'bad-password');

// Returns false because the value of the hashed attempted
// password does not match the hash in the database
if ($auth->isValid()) { }

// Attempt #2
$auth->authenticate('admin', '12admin34');

// Returns true because the value of the hashed attempted
// password matches the hash in the database
if ($auth->isValid()) { } 
```

### Authenticate using HTTP

In this example, the user can simply authenticate using a remote server over HTTP.
Based on the headers received from the initial request, the Http adapter will
auto-detect most things, like the the auth type (Basic or Digest), content encoding, etc.

```php
use Pop\Auth\Auth;
use Pop\Auth\Adapter\Http;

$auth = new Auth(new Http('https://www.domain.com/auth', 'post'));
$auth->authenticate('admin', '12admin34');

if ($auth->isValid()) { } // Returns true 
```

### Authenticate using LDAP

Again, in this example, the user can simply authenticate using a remote server, but this
time, using LDAP. The user can set the port and other various options that may be necessary
to communicate with the LDAP server.

```php
use Pop\Auth\Auth;
use Pop\Auth\Adapter\Ldap;

$auth = new Auth(new Ldap('ldap.domain', 389, [LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION => 3]));
$auth->authenticate('admin', '12admin34');

if ($auth->isValid()) { } // Returns true 
```
